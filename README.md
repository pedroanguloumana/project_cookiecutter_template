# Atmospheric Science Python Project Template

> [!NOTE]
> This project is based heavily on the [true-neutral-cookiecutter](https://github.com/patrickmineault/true-neutral-cookiecutter), as well as by the information contained in [The Good Research Code Handbook] (https://goodresearch.dev/)

## Why this template?
This template is designed to consolidate practices I have adopted as a practicing researcher. This template is meant to make the flow from
- Initial exploration and hypothesis testing
- Generation of publication-ready figures
- Incorporation of publication-ready figures into manuscript drafts
- Modification of publication-ready figures 

As fluid as possible. 

## Making figures for the paper
Inside ```/writing/```  is a blank Keynote presentation. To make the figures:
1. Import panels from ```/figures/``` into the presentation. Each slide is a figure. 
2. Once all the figures are made, run ```make``` from ```/writing/```. 
3. If you want to edit figures, edit them in Keynote and run ```make``` again.
