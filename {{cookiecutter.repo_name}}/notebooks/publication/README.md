# Publication Notebooks

This folder contains clean, reproducible notebooks used to generate finalized outputs for papers, presentations, and reports. These notebooks should run top-to-bottom and save all figures, tables, and processed results to the appropriate directories.

Examples:
- Generating publication-quality figures
- Producing tables or statistics for manuscripts
- Exporting datasets or summaries used in a paper
- Creating slides or report graphics
