# Exploratory Notebooks

This folder contains scratch and exploratory notebooks used to inspect data, test ideas, and develop analysis workflows. These notebooks are informal, iterative, and may not run top-to-bottom.

Examples:
- Inspecting new datasets
- Trying out transformations, filters, or heuristics
- Testing plotting approaches or diagnostics
- Quick calculations or sanity checks
